# RadioKit-Single-View-Objective-C-Demo
Demo of a simple single view RadioKit project, written in Objective-C

This is a simple demonstation of using the [RadioKit SDK](http://www.stormyprods.com/products/radiokit.php) in a 
single view radio app.   It shows the use of the rewind and fast forward controls as well as using a simple 4-bar
audio-gain visualization that moves in response to the stereo channel volume during stream playback.

RadioKit is a commercial SDK that requires a license key in order for it to function beyond 10 minutes of playback.  While in demo mode it is fully functional, however after 10 minutes of time audio playback will be halted and the app will need to be restarted to test again.

For more information on the full features of RadioKit please refer to the [Stormy Productions](http://www.stormyprods.com/products/radiokit.php) website.
